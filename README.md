# OneNote Ferdi Recipe (also works with Franz).

## Requirements
This recipe only works for Ferdi and Franz 5.X. 

## Installation

1. Clone/download the folder `recipe-ferdi-onenote`.

2. Open the Ferdi Recipe folder on your machine:
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Ferdi/recipes/`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Ferdi/recipes/`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Ferdi/recipes/`

3. Create a `dev` folder if you have not already done so

3. Unzip and copy the `recipe-ferdi-onenote` folder into the recipes dev directory

4. Restart Ferdi; go to Settings --> Available services --> Custom services tab

5. The OneNote icon should show at the bottom under "Community 3rd party recipes", but due to caching, you might not see it appear until you restart your machine.

6. Go to your One Note notebook of choice in a browser, and copy the full URL.

6. In the OneNote service settings, enter the URL into the "Team" field.
